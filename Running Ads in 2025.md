Running Ads in 2025

This video features an experienced Google Ads expert who shares a comprehensive framework for managing and optimizing Google Ads accounts in 2025, emphasizing the shift in strategy driven by advances in AI and changes in search behavior. Drawing on over a decade of experience and insights from working with over 100 companies monthly, the expert outlines how Google Ads has evolved from manual, keyword-obsessed tactics to a data-driven, AI-trained approach requiring strategic oversight rather than micro-management.

Key Insights
Google Ads in 2025 is fundamentally different from how it was managed years ago due to the integration of AI and the evolution of search behavior.
The future of search is moving from keyword-based queries to conversational AI interactions, with Google introducing an AI search mode to handle more natural, intent-based queries.
Old Google Ads management tactics are obsolete, including daily bid adjustments, heavy keyword segmentation (e.g., Single Keyword Ad Groups - SCAGs), and manual control over every campaign detail.
The new era demands a strategic overseer role: advertisers must train Google’s AI with high-quality conversion data and let AI optimize campaigns.
Keywords are no longer destinations but navigational signals that indicate user intent; campaigns should focus on intent and broaden targeting with smart bidding and broad match keywords.
Data quality and integration (e.g., offline conversions, CRM data) are crucial to train Google’s AI effectively and improve campaign scalability and efficiency.
The recommended approach involves consolidated campaign structures, fewer keywords per ad group, and thematic keyword grouping instead of exhaustive keyword lists and micro-segmentation.
Patience and trust in AI learning cycles are essential—avoid constant manual optimizations which disrupt AI learning.
Broad match keywords combined with smart bidding represent a powerful, scalable approach once the account is properly trained and stabilized.
Advertisers should focus on conversion optimization, business intelligence, and creative optimization rather than daily tweaking.
Evolution of Search and Its Impact on Google Ads
Aspect	Past (Keyword-Based Search)	Present/Future (Conversational AI Search)
Search Behavior	Direct, keyword-focused queries	Conversational, intent-driven queries
Keyword Role	Exact matching to capture search queries	Navigational signals indicating intent
Ad Strategy	Keyword segmentation, micro bidding	Broad match + smart bidding, fewer keywords
User Interaction	Typing keywords	Conversing with AI, providing detailed context
Funnel Stage Search Focus	Mostly keyword precision across all stages	Conversational at top funnel, transactional bottom funnel (still keyword-driven)
Old vs New Google Ads Management Paradigms
Factor	Old Way	New Way (2025)
Account Management	Daily bid adjustments, manual control	Strategic oversight, guiding AI with data
Keyword Strategy	Thousands of keywords, SCAG structure, match type segmentation	Fewer, highly themed keywords; broad + exact match; intent grouping
Data Usage	Basic conversion tracking (form fills, clicks)	High-quality conversion data, offline and CRM integration
Campaign Structure	Highly segmented by keywords and match types	Consolidated campaigns with more volume
Mindset	Traffic buyer, keyword hunter	AI trainer, conversion optimizer, strategic guider
Optimization Frequency	Daily micro-optimizations	Patience, avoid over-optimizing, focus on data feeding
Bidding Strategy	Manual bidding, penny bid adjustments	Smart bidding (target CPA, ROAS)
Framework for Successful Google Ads Management in 2025
Phase	Description	Key Actions & Focus
Phase 1: Quality Data Collection	Foundation of proper tracking and high-quality conversions	Set up enhanced conversions, offline tracking, customer matching; prepare first-party data feeds
Phase 2: Conversion Volume Ramp-up	Increase conversion volume to enable learning by AI	Aim for 30+ conversions/month; resist daily changes; prioritize quality over quantity
Phase 3: Smart Bidding Implementation	Transition bidding strategies to AI-driven smart bidding	Use target CPA or target ROAS; stabilize performance; trust AI optimizations
Phase 4: Broad Match Expansion	Expand keyword targeting to include broad match to capture intent	Layer broad match keywords with smart bidding; use broad match to tap into intent signals
Phase 5: Scaling & Funnel Expansion	Scale campaigns intelligently and move up the marketing funnel	Add new campaign types; scale based on high-quality data and AI insights
Keyword Strategy: Then vs Now
Aspect	Old Keyword Strategy	New Keyword Strategy
Number of Keywords	Thousands per account	Fewer, consolidated, highly themed groups
Match Types	Segmented by match type (exact, phrase, broad)	Start with exact and phrase; add broad match later once trained
Focus	Controlling every search query	Using keywords as intent signals for AI
Campaign Structure	SCAGs (Single Keyword Ad Groups), fragmented	Consolidated campaigns, grouped by theme
Optimization	Manual, micro adjustments daily	Smart bidding, AI-driven learning
Practical Example: Kitchen Remodeler Campaign Strategy
Starting Point: Focus on core, high-value service area (e.g., kitchen renovations) rather than broad categories (e.g., home renovations).
Keyword Selection: Begin with phrase and exact match keywords focused on high-intent searches (e.g., “kitchen renovation Miami”).
Bidding Strategy: Start with manual CPC or max clicks to ramp up conversion volume.
Tracking Setup: Implement enhanced conversions and offline tracking to capture real sales data.
Data Feeding: Gradually feed high-value conversion data (actual sales, not just leads) back to Google.
Smart Bidding: Transition to smart bidding once sufficient conversion volume and quality data are collected.
Broad Match Layering: After stabilizing smart bidding, add broad match keywords to expand intent-based targeting.
Ongoing Role: Act as a strategic overseer monitoring performance and feeding quality data rather than micromanaging daily.
Core Concepts & Definitions
Term	Definition
AI Search Mode	A new Google feature enabling conversational, intent-driven search interactions
Smart Bidding	Automated bidding strategies using machine learning to optimize for conversion goals
Broad Match Keywords	Keyword match type that triggers ads for searches related to the keyword’s intent, not exact wording
Enhanced Conversions	Improved conversion tracking that uses user data to better attribute conversions
Offline Conversion Tracking	Importing offline sales data (e.g., CRM sales) back into Google Ads for AI training
SCAG (Single Keyword Ad Group)	A campaign structure with one keyword per ad group, common in older Google Ads strategies
Professional Recommendations
Stop micro-managing your Google Ads account daily; this disrupts AI learning and reduces performance.
Feed Google Ads AI with high-quality, conversion-level data, not just lead form fills or low-value conversions.
Consolidate campaigns and ad groups to aggregate data and allow AI to better optimize.
Use phrase and exact match keywords when starting out, then gradually add broad match keywords with smart bidding.
Group keywords by intent and theme, not by isolated individual terms.
Integrate first-party data such as offline sales and CRM data for more precise AI training.
Exercise patience and trust the AI learning process; avoid frequent changes that reset learning phases.
Focus on strategic oversight, conversion optimization, and business intelligence instead of tactical control.
Conclusion
Managing Google Ads in 2025 requires a paradigm shift from old school keyword hunting and daily bid tinkering towards training and guiding AI with high-quality data. The expert stresses that Google Ads is now akin to training a custom large language model (LLM) for your business, where the quality of data fed into the system determines the quality of results. Advertisers must adapt by consolidating campaign structures, embracing smart bidding, integrating first-party data, and focusing on thematic, intent-based keyword strategies. Patience and strategic oversight replace micro-management, enabling marketers to harness Google’s AI to scale effectively and efficiently.
