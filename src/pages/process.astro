            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Launch campaigns fast, make daily "optimizations" to show they're working hard, panic when results aren't immediate, change strategy in Week 3, reset the learning process, repeat. You're paying them to sabotage your account.

              We don't touch campaigns yet. We fix your broken tracking, connect your CRM so Google sees real sales (not form fills), and identify where you're wasting money. Without this, everything else fails.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              We launch simplified campaigns and then... we wait. This is the hardest month for clients because nothing looks broken, but you're used to agencies changing things daily. We don't. We're letting Google's AI learn who your customers are. Patience here = results later.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Smart bidding turns on. Google starts automatically adjusting prices to hit your goals. Your cost-per-sale becomes predictable. This only works because we built the foundation in Weeks 1-6.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Now we scale. The system is trained. The math is predictable. You can confidently increase spend because you know what revenue to expect. This is when clients finally understand why we didn't rush.

              We're not in emergency mode anymore. We're strategically guiding the AI, monitoring performance, and maintaining the system. You have predictable customer acquisition costs. You can plan your business around it.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Other agencies promise results in 30 days because that's what you want to hear. We promise results in 90 days because that's how long it actually takes to train Google's AI properly. If someone tells you they can do it faster, they're either lying or they're going to reset your learning phase every other week.
